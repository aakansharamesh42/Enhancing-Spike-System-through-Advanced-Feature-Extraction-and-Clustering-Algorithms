# Enhancing-Spike-System-through-Advanced-Feature-Extraction-and-Clustering-Algorithms
This project focuses on enhancing spike sorting for HD-MEAs neural data. It explores various feature extraction techniques (PCA, ICA, UMAP, Isomap) and clustering algorithms (K-means, HDBSCAN, etc.). The study reveals that HDBSCAN with PCA offers the best performance with 0.87 accuracy, balancing noise reduction and computational efficiency.
